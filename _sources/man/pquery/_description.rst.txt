Description
===========

pquery is used to extract various kinds of information about either installed
or uninstalled packages. From an overall usage standpoint it is similar to
equery, but it can do things equery cannot do and is a bit more flexible.

What pquery does is select packages from one or more repos that match
a boolean combination of restrictions, then print selected information about
those packages. It is important to understand that the information printing and
repo selection options are almost completely separate from the
restriction options. The only exception to that is that restrictions on
contents automatically select the vdb (installed packages) repo, since
running them on source repos makes no sense.
