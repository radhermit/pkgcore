Description
===========

pinspect is used to extract various information from repos. For example,
it can perform aggregated EAPI, license, eclass, and mirror usage queries
across specified repos. Any repo type can be queried, e.g. ebuild,
binary, or vdb.

It also provides an interface to all profile specific metadata, e.g. package
masks, inheritance trees, etc. This makes it easier to inspect profile
differences without sorting through the inheritance tree and reading the raw
files.

Finally, a portageq compatible interface is provided for several commands that
were historically used in ebuilds.
