Positional Arguments
====================

:TARGET:  
        Various target arguments are supported including the following:
        
        atom
            An extended atom syntax is supported, see the related section
            in pkgcore(5).
        
        package set
            Used to define lists of packages, the syntax used for these is
            @pkgset. For example, the @system and @world package sets are
            supported.
        
        extended globbing
            Globbing package names or atoms allows for use cases such as
            ``'far*'`` (merge every package starting with 'far'),
            ``'dev-python/*::gentoo'`` (merge every package in the dev-python
            category from the gentoo repo), or even '*' (merge everything).
        
        Also, the target '-' allows targets to be read from standard input.

Base Options
============

-h, --help       
                 Show this help message and exit. To get more
                 information see the related man page.

--version        
                 Show this program's version information and exit.
                 
                 When running from within a git repo or a version
                 installed from git the latest commit hash and date will
                 be shown.

--debug          
                 Enable debug checks and show verbose debug output.

-q, --quiet      
                 Suppress non-error, informational messages.

-v, --verbose    
                 Increase the verbosity of various output.

--color BOOLEAN  
                 Toggle colored output support. This can be used to forcibly
                 enable color support when piping output or other sitations
                 where stdout is not a tty.

Config Options
==============

--add-config SECTION KEY VALUE  
                                modify existing pkgcore config section

--new-config SECTION KEY VALUE  
                                add new pkgcore config section

--empty-config                  
                                skip loading user/system pkgcore config

--config PATH                   
                                use custom pkgcore config file

--domain DOMAIN                 
                                custom pkgcore domain to use for this operation

Operations
==========

-u, --upgrade    
                 Try to upgrade specified targets to the latest visible version. Note
                 that altered package visibility due to keywording or masking can often
                 hide the latest versions of packages, especially for stable
                 configurations.

-d, --downgrade  
                 Try to downgrade specified targets to a lower visible version
                 compared to what's currently installed.
                 
                 Useful for reverting to the previously installed package version;
                 however, note that the -O/--nodeps option is generally used with this
                 otherwise lots of downgrades will be pulled into the resolved deptree.

-C, --unmerge    
                 Target packages for unmerging from the system.
                 
                 WARNING: This does not ask for user confirmation for any targets so
                 it's possible to quickly break a system.

--clean          
                 Remove installed packages that aren't referenced by any target packages
                 or sets. This defaults to using the world and system sets if no targets
                 are specified.
                 
                 Use with *caution*, this option used incorrectly can render your system
                 unusable. Note that this implies --deep.

--list-sets      
                 display the list of available package sets

Resolver Options
================

-p, --pretend                                          
                                                       Resolve package dependencies and display the results without performing
                                                       any merges.

-a, --ask                                              
                                                       Perform the dependency resolution, but ask for user confirmation before
                                                       beginning the fetch/build/merge process. The choice defaults to yes so
                                                       pressing the "Enter" key will trigger acceptance.

-f, --fetchonly                                        
                                                       Only perform fetching of all targets from SRC_URI based on the current
                                                       USE configuration.

-1, --oneshot                                          
                                                       Build and merge packages normally, but do not add any targets to the
                                                       world file. Note that this is forcibly enabled if a package set is
                                                       specified.

-D, --deep                                             
                                                       Force dependency resolution across the entire dependency tree for all
                                                       specified targets.

-N, --newuse                                           
                                                       Include installed packages with USE flag changes in the list of viable
                                                       targets for rebuilding.
                                                       
                                                       USE flag changes include flags being added, removed, enabled, or
                                                       disabled with regards to a package. USE flag changes can occur via
                                                       ebuild alterations, profile updates, or local configuration
                                                       modifications.
                                                       
                                                       Note that this option implies -1/--oneshot.

-i, --ignore-cycles                                    
                                                       Ignore dependency cycles if they're found to be unbreakable; for
                                                       example: a depends on b, and b depends on a, with neither built.

--with-bdeps                                           
                                                       Pull in build time dependencies for built packages during dependency
                                                       resolution, by default they're ignored.

-O, --nodeps                                           
                                                       Build and merge packages without resolving any dependencies.

-o, --onlydeps                                         
                                                       Build and merge only the dependencies for the packages specified.

-n, --noreplace                                        
                                                       Skip packages that are already installed. By default when running
                                                       without this option, any specified target packages will be remerged
                                                       regardless of if they are already installed.

-b, --buildpkg                                         
                                                       Force binary packages to be built for all merged packages.

-k, --usepkg                                           
                                                       Binary packages are preferred over ebuilds when performing dependency
                                                       resolution.

-K, --usepkgonly                                       
                                                       Only binary packages are considered when performing dependency
                                                       resolution.

-S, --source-only                                      
                                                       Only ebuilds are considered when performing dependency
                                                       resolution.

-e, --empty                                            
                                                       Force all targets and their dependencies to be rebuilt.

-x TARGET[,TARGET,...], --exclude TARGET[,TARGET,...]  
                                                       Comma-separated list of targets to pretend are installed.
                                                       
                                                       This supports extended package globbing, e.g. ``'dev-python/*'``
                                                       equates to faking the entire dev-python category is installed.

--ignore-failures                                      
                                                       Skip failures during the following phases: sanity checks
                                                       (pkg_pretend), fetching, dep resolution, and (un)merging.

--force                                                
                                                       Force (un)merging on the livefs (vdb), regardless of if it's frozen.

--preload-vdb-state                                    
                                                       Preload the installed package database which causes the resolver to
                                                       work with a complete graph, thus disallowing actions that conflict with
                                                       installed packages. If disabled, it's possible for the requested action
                                                       to conflict with already installed dependencies that aren't involved in
                                                       the graph of the requested operation.

Output Options
==============

--quiet-repo-display                 
                                     In the package merge list display, suppress ::repo output and instead
                                     use index numbers to indicate which repos packages come from.

-F FORMATTER, --formatter FORMATTER  
                                     Select an output formatter to use for text formatting of --pretend or
                                     --ask output, currently available formatters include the following:
                                     basic, pkgcore, portage, portage-verbose, and paludis.
                                     
                                     The basic formatter is the nearest to simple text output and is
                                     intended for scripting while the portage/portage-verbose formatter
                                     closely emulates portage output and is used by default.
